            <p>Some of the R transformations you run may require installing an R library.  Not all users have access to install R libraries in a central location, so the default setting is to leave this ticked and install R libraries into a per-user directory inside the Columnal settings.  Untick if you want the default R installation behaviour (see the install.packages and .libPaths R functions for more documentation of the default behaviour).</p>
