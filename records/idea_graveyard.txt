Could add idea of absolute units (with | symbol at start):
 - Cannot add two absolute together
 - Abs + rel gives abs, rel + rel gives rel
 - Abs minus abs is rel, abs minus rel is abs, rel minus abs is error, rel minus rel is rel
 - Abs times anything disallowed, rel times rel is rel^2
 - Abs divide anything disallowed
 - Can you have an absolute composite unit or only absolute single unit?
However, this gets awkward. So few units have absolute or relative.  Are angle-degrees an absolute or a relative unit?
Temperature can have the distinction, but not distance
Years can, and months, but not really days.  Hours can, but should use time really
Coordinates can, but it gets fiddly to perform certain expressions.
Overall, not worth the extra effort and confusion.
