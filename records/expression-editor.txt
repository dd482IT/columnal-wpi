Adjacent items is never valid.  Always item-operator-item, etc

Tags w/ inner and function calls are one item with args (like Stride brackets, but the function call/tag is glued to the opening bracket)

No special characters to distinguish any of them, all done in auto complete

String literal as in Stride, press quote to enter, backspace at end to turn back into ordinary

Special all & only functions for column references, available in auto complete like:
   Card  -- Only available from this table
   Card  [all]
   Const.Foo [all]
   Const.Foo  [only]  -- Only available if known to be size 1, and from another table.

Add operator for String concat?  ++ is awkward I think, maybe ~

Comma is just an operator

When operators are mixed, offer quick fix to bracket one way or the other
