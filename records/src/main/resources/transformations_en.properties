sort.description=Sorts the whole table in order of the values in one or more columns.
filter.description=Only keeps the rows which match the given expression.  The expression is evaluated separately for each row, and if the resulting value is true, the row is kept.  If the expression value is false, the row is left out of the result and any further transformations.
