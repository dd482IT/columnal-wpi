Add functions, such as:
 string<->date and date arithmetic (then add expression date tests)
 floor, ceil,
 log10,log,ln,
 round.to.dp,
 tostring/fromstring,
 upper, lower, startswith,
 modulo
 c(col): gets single value from that column
Add tests for date formats and date functions
Allow double dollar as an anonymous variable name in matches
Add tests for runtime errors (division by zero, invalid dates, incomplete pattern matches, if we allow those)
Look up Unicode string collations, both for user values (in columns) and things like function names, constructor names
Implement and test complete load/save, including units and types sections
Intern the strings
Explicitly test core functions like multiplyNumbers, compareLists
