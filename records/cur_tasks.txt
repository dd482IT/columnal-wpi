Add functions, such as:
 remaining date/time functions and date arithmetic
 floor, ceil,
 log10,log,ln,
 round.to.dp,
 tostring/fromstring,
 upper, lower, startswith,
 average,
 min, max,
 modulo
 Add these two as auto-complete options:
   only(col): gets single value from that column (not usable on current table)
   all(col): gets whole column

++ for string concat?  Or maybe ~ ?  Or overload + (and for array concat)
Change some of the symbols to _keywords
Allow method calls on tuple parameter list?
Allow double dollar as an anonymous variable name in matches
Add tests for runtime errors (division by zero, invalid dates, incomplete pattern matches, if we allow those)
Look up Unicode string collations, both for user values (in columns) and things like function names, constructor names
Implement and test complete load/save, including units and types sections
Intern the strings (i.e. for translation)
Explicitly test core functions like multiplyNumbers, compareLists
Finish GUI for import choices
Allow quoting of columns (and escaping?) in input files
