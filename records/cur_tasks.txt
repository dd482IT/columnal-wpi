Add functions, such as:
 floor, ceil
 upper, lower, startswith
 c(col): gets single value from that column
Allow double dollar as an anonymous variable name in matches
Add tests for runtime errors (division by zero, incomplete pattern matches, if we allow those)
Look up Unicode string collations, both for user values (in columns) and things like function names, constructor names
Implement and test complete load/save, including units and types sections
Intern the strings
Explicitly test core functions like multiplyNumbers, compareLists
