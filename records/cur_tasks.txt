Add (including units): TimesExpression
Generate match expressions for testing values
Add power expression (x^n), right-hand side must be constant rational if left-hand side is non-scalar
   (will need constant folding: use getValue but with an EvaluateState that throws a particular exception)
Add tests for runtime errors (division by zero, incomplete pattern matches, if we allow those)
Then go on to add functions, such as:
 as{unit}(number); can't be used to-from scalars, only within same units differing by scale
 c(col): gets single value from that column
Look up Unicode string collations, both for user values (in columns) and things like function names, constructor names
Implement and test complete load/save, including units and types sections
