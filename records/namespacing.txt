Namespacing
===

Some items must share a namespace, others can do, and/or maybe disambiguate.  Possible items overall:

 - Standard function names
 - User-defined variables
 - Tag type names
 - Individual tag names
 - Table names
 - Column names
 - Special commands (@if, @entire, @anything, etc)
 - Operators
 
Prohibited characters:
 - Nothing is allowed to have @, besides special commands
 - Spaces allowed in everything, but only single spaces between non-spaces.  Leading/trailing spaces will be trimmed.  Same rule for underscores.
 - Operator characters not allowed in identifiers.
 - Identifiers must be (Unicode) alphabetic, followed by alphanumeric or underscore or space (with above caveats).

Unlikely/unproblematic clashes:
 - Tag type names are only in expressions as scope for individual tag names, so they are not a problem, as long as they don't clash with each other.
 - Individual tag names must be unique in that type, but multiple types can have the same tag name, as you can use the type name to disambiguate.
 - Column names in a given table must be unique.  Table names must be unique.
 
Strategies:
 - Tags must be selected from autocomplete to be valid, so they can be allowed to clash.  Same for table names, column names, functions.
 - Variable declaration in let is explicit, only question is in pattern match.  Require explicit prefix, like @var something or $something.
