NOTE: This file has a very particular syntax.  Follow the existing format exactly; each item must be Version X.Y.Z.A (YYYY-MM-DD) header, followed by one line of the short version shown in the news and upgrade banner, followed by arbitary Markdown for the fuller description (usually bullet list, but doesn't have to be).
