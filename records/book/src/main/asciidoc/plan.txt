Aim:
 - Micro lessons are useful on-demand but won't explain underlying concepts and principles.
 - The book is for explaining the underlying model and deeper concepts

Key topics:
 - Types
   - Tagged types
   - Record types
   - Numerical units
   - Temporal
 - Immutability
 - Transformations
   - Filter and sort
   - Aggregate
 - Version control/file format
   - Diffing
   - Merging

Possible outline:
 1. Principles: types, immutability and transformation
Part 1: Types
 2. Tagged types: solutions for missing data and complex data
 3. Numerical units: safer tracking for calculations
 4. Temporal types: differences and usage
 5. Lists: uses and powerful
 6. Type summary: when to use sum, product and list types, and combinations thereof.
Part 2: Data and transformation
 7. Import and export
 8. Immutability: never edit data table
 9. Transformations overview: why have them, and different types
 10. Filter and sort
 11. Calculate
 12. Aggregate
 13. Concat and join
Part 3: Expressions
 1. Overview
 2. Operators
 3. Functions
 4. Control structures
 5. Define
 6. Functions 
Part 4: Version Control
 1. What is version control and why should you use it
 2. Diffing: understanding diffs
 3. Merging: how to merge and what to do it if goes wrong.
