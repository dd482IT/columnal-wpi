= Record types

Sometimes a value will have multiple consituent parts.  For example, a GPS position will have latitude and longitude.  A colour may be represented as red, green and blue values.  It can be useful to represent such compound values as a record type.

A record type is a collection of fields.  Each field has a name and a type.  So `(latitude: Number, longitude: Number)` is a record type with two fields.  One is called latitude, the other longitude, and they are both numbers.

There are two approaches to storing compound data like this.  One approach is to use a separate column for each part, for example a Number column for longitude and a second Number column for latitude.  The alternate approach is to use a record type that combines these two into a single column.  The record approach is particularly useful if the record type will be used as part of another type, for example inside an Optional type or inside a list.
