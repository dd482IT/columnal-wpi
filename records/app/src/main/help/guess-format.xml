        <short>The scheme used to encode characters in the file.</short>
        <full>There are lots of different characters in the world: Latin characters (as used in the English alphabet),
            Arabic, Chinese and many more besides.  An encoding scheme is the way in which these characters
        are numbered and stored in a file.  Unfortunately, historically every sub-region had its own encoding,
        and if you get the encoding mismatched, you will get weird characters.  Recently, UTF-8 has become
        something of a common standard, but many other encoding schemes are still in use.  Try UTF-8 first,
        but try then others if that doesn't work.</full>
