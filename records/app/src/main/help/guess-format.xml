        <short>The scheme used to encode characters in the file.  UTF-8 is the most likely choice.</short>
        <full>There are lots of different characters in the world: Latin characters (as used in the English alphabet),
            Arabic, Chinese and many more besides.  An encoding scheme is the way in which these characters
        are numbered and stored in a file.  Unfortunately, historically every sub-region had its own encoding,
        and if you get the encoding mismatched, you will get weird characters.  Recently, UTF-8 has become
        something of a common standard, but many other encoding schemes are still in use.  Try UTF-8 first,
        but try then others if that doesn't work.</full>

        <short>How many rows to skip at the beginning of the file.</short>
        <full>There are often header rows at the beginning of the file which
        do not contain useful data.  This number is how many rows to skip.  The
        last row is taken to be the names of the columns.</full>

    <help id="quote" title="Quote Character">
        <short>The character used to surround columns.</short>
        <full>Text files use a particular character, such as a comma,
        to separate the columns.  But some pieces of text may actually
        contain a comma.  So quotes are sometimes used to surround
        text values in columns.</full>

        <short>The number of columns to use in the file.</short>
        <full>If every row has the same number of columns then
        this is fixed.  If there is a varying number of columns
        then you must specify the current number.</full>
