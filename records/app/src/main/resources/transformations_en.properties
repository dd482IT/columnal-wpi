hide.description.short=Hides some or all of the source table's columns.
hide.description.rest=The columns will not be displayed in the result, not can they accessed by any further transformations.  This means that the names of the hidden columns will not clash with any new names introduced by later transformations. 
sort.description.short=Sorts the whole table by the values in one or more columns.
sort.description.rest=The columns will be used in order; only if one column has equal values in two rows will the next column be used.  All columns are sorted using their in-built ordering: if you want a custom ordering, use a calculation transformation first. 
filter.description=Only keeps the rows which match the given expression.  The expression is evaluated separately for each row, and if the resulting value is true, the row is kept.  If the expression value is false, the row is left out of the result and any further transformations.
