Columnal allows you to process data.  [animate in an example value as it is spoken, with white space between]

Every item of data has a type like number or date. [animate in the type above the item]

Columns of data all have the same type, [animate in further data items below the number and date]
and they always have a name [animate in a name]

Tables are a collection of columns of the same length [join the columns together]

There are two kinds of table: the first kind are data tables which you can import from files or webpages, [show CSV, XLS, HTML]
or type in; [animate typing a value]
the second kind are transformations like sort, [animate a sort]
or filtering. [animate filtering]

You can chain transformations together, so for example you can filter then sum. [animate this]

When you're done, you can also export your results to a variety of formats (show CSV, for now)

Columnal is free and available now. [Show logo and URL]
