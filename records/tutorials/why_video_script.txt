Abstract
===
Want to give reasons why Columnal is different and better than other solutions in under 3 minutes.  Key points:
 - Constructive not destructive [better than Excel]
 - Safer; types prevent mistakes [better than everything]
 - Supportive; provide hints and tips at every turn [better than everything]
 - Live; see the results of every step [better than R/Python]
 - No walls; easy to get data in and out [better than Excel]
