A full range of date/time types might be:
  - Year
  - Month [Enum]
  - Day
  - Year&Month
  - Date (Year&Month&Day)
  - DayOfWeek
  - TimeOfDay (Hour&Minute&Second&Nanosecond)
  - TimeZoned (TimeOfDay&Timezone)
  - TimeDuration (Nanoseconds)
  - DateDifference (Years&Months&Days)
  - DateTime (Date&TimeOfDay)
  - DateTimeZoned (DateTime&Timezone), where time zone may be offset or named time zone

These types can just be a number with a unit:
  - Year
  - Month (then have constants for month names)
  - Day
  - DayOfWeek (then have constants for month names) - OPTIONAL
  - TimeDuration

These should be special:
  - Date (Year&Month&Day)
  - Year&Month
  - TimeOfDay
  - DateDifference (OPTIONAL, maybe omit to begin with)
  - DateTime
  - DateTimeZoned

This can all form into one datetime type, which can be:
  - Date:
    - YMD
    - YM
  - Time:
    - HMinS
    - HMinSZ
  - Datetime:
    - YMBHMinS
    - YMBHMinSZ
Remember: the exact one of these is known upfront statically during type-check

We can allow arithmetic on these:

  (Date|DateTime +- year|month...)
  (Date|DateTime +- day...)  [but not mix of day with year or month because ambiguous]
  (Time|DateTime +- hour|min|sec...)

Difference calculations must use function


So, functions needed:
  date() - converts string|datetime to date
  dateym() - converts string|datetime to date with only year and month
  time() - converts string|datetime to time (no zone)
  timez() - converts string|datetimezone|time&zone to time (with zone)
  datetime() - converts string|date&time to datetime (no zone)
  datetimez() - converts string|datetime&zone|date&time&zone to datetime (with zone)
  year() - gets year from date|datetime
  month() - gets month from date|datetime
  dayofmonth() - gets dayofmonth from date|datetime
  hour() - gets hour from time|datetime
  minute() - gets hour from time|datetime
  second() - gets hour from time|datetime
  zone() - gets timezone (as string) from timezone|datetimezone
  formatdatetime() - formats date|time|datetime into string
  daydiff() - gets number of days between two dates (not datetimes)
  seconddiff() - gets number of seconds between two datetimes (both with zone or both not), or two times (both with zone or both not)
