A full range of date/time types might be:
  - Year
  - Month [Enum]
  - Day
  - Year&Month
  - Date (Year&Month&Day)
  - DayOfWeek
  - TimeOfDay (Hour&Minute&Second&Nanosecond)
  - TimeZoned (TimeOfDay&Timezone)
  - TimeDuration (Nanoseconds)
  - DateDifference (Years&Months&Days)
  - DateTime (Date&TimeOfDay)
  - DateTimeZoned (DateTime&Timezone), where time zone may be offset or named time zone

These types can just be a number with a unit:
  - Year
  - Month (then have constants for month names)
  - Day
  - DayOfWeek (then have constants for month names) - OPTIONAL
  - TimeDuration

These should be special:
  - Date (Year&Month&Day)
  - Year&Month
  - TimeOfDay
  - DateDifference (OPTIONAL, maybe omit to begin with)
  - DateTime
  - DateTimeZoned

This can all form into one datetime type, which can be:
  - Date:
    - YMD
    - YM
  - Time:
    - HMinS
    - HMinSZ
  - Datetime:
    - YMBHMinS
    - YMBHMinSZ
