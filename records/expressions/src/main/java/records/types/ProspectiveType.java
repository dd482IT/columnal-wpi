/**
 * We have the following concrete/terminal types:
 *  - Boolean
 *  - Number
 *  - String
 *  - Date/time types
 * The following composite types:
 *  - an ADT, which at the type level can take a list of 0+ type parameters
 *  - a list, which can be thought of as an in-built ADT taking one type parameter
 *  - a tuple, which can be thought as an in-built ADT taking 2+ parameters
 * Because some functions take a tuple with any number of parameters, we have a special case for this
 *
 * 
 * The following is a pseudo-GADT for types which we will one day expose to the user for dynamic typing
 * so that you can process a column dynamically as (Type a, [a]) :
 * 
 * data Constructor a where
 *   -- construct, deconstruct, Type
 *   Cons :: (b -> a) -> (a -> Maybe b) -> Type b -> Constructor a 
 * 
 * data TupleElem a where
 *   -- deconstruct, setter
 *   Elem :: (a -> b) -> (b -> a -> a) -> Type b -> TupleElem a
 *   
 * data Type a where
 *   Num :: Type Number
 *   Bool :: Type Boolean
 *   Text :: Type String
 *   Date :: Type Date (etc -- several of these)
 *   -- Tagged data types: 
 *   Composite :: [(String, Maybe (Constructor a))] -> Type a
 *   List :: Type a -> Type [a]
 *   Tuple :: [TupleElem a] -> Type a
 *   
 *   
 * Meanwhile, we need a prospective type while doing type inference.  That is similar to the above
 * but has some different fields ready for unification:
 * 
 * -- Note in Sheard that TypeExp a is only carrying around ST parameter, TypeExp doesn't actually
 * -- need a type argument. 
 * 
 * data TypeExp where
 *   -- Note, in the Sheard paper that Ptr is a custom type, not an in-built one!
 *   MutVar :: IORef (Maybe TypeExp) -> TypeExp
 *   -- Don't really understand GenVar, yet:
 *   GenVar :: Int -> TypeExp
 *   -- We need a special case for numbers due to units:
 *   NumType :: Unit -> TypeExp
 *   -- We have special case for primitives although original algorithm doesn't:
 *   PrimType :: String -> TypeExp
 *   AlgType :: String -> Maybe (TypeExp a) -> TypeExp
 *   ListType :: TypeExp -> TypeExp
 *   -- Tuples are difficult primarily due to type of functions like "first":
 *   TupleType :: Tuple -> TypeExp
 *   
 * -- This is like a list type, but distinguishes don't-care (used by "first" for the
 * rest of the tuple) from empty.
 * data Tuple where
 *   Any :: Tuple
 *   End :: Tuple
 *   TCons :: TypeExp -> Tuple -> Tuple
