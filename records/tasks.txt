Express Priority (needed for task C)
===
Probably fixed by recent changes but not definite
---
- Phil B3_1 12:07 autocomplete is blank, ditto B5 1:19
- Why doesn't Pete Antony completion show?  (Jon A3A4, 4:40, and 6:00ish)  Code completion blank but shouldn't be.


High Priority (major bugs/deficiencies, cannot do beta without fixing)
===
- Server internal exception logging (and stats logging?)
- Undo area in import dialog does not redisplay RHS

- Manual edit pick primary key is too confusing
  - Row number should not be default
- No autocomplete on picking column in manual edit
- Manual edit dialog pick column is modal and doesn't allow column picking
- Manual edit summary dialog very weird when no edits to show

- Not obvious enough to type to see more auto complete?  (Esp when scroll not obvious)
- Lots of confusion between date literals and date functions.
- No undo while editing a cell value
- Investigate improving layout for long expressions
- Record syntax does not directly solve the "to date" from datetime, datetimezoned problems.
  - But could offer an hms from time that gives back all three in a record, rather than individual accessors.


Medium Priority (significant quality of life, but not essential especially for beta)
===
- Could improve table name on HTML import; number doesn't need so many digits!
- Text entry box for row and column limits in the import dialog?
- Undo area/Reset area, rename to selection?
- No mouse-over highlight in table autocomplete
- Bit weird in type dialog specifically to have the autocomplete insert at cursor rather than replacing altogether. But maybe we just have to live with that?
- Conversion from Text to Date highlighted all rows as wrong; but surely the valid dates should have converted?
- Looked for text to date by typing date, but function is from text
- Pin button for function documentation to allow seeing it while entering?
- Calculate: not clear how to abandon but save.  Change OK/Cancel to Save/Remove?
- Number column formatting doesn't re-run when dragging column divider, which is confusing.  Run more frequently during drag?
- Have to click too many times on completion in Aggregate dialog (Phil B7_1 3:10); should only be two at most?
- Add quick fix for case of comparing temporal type to number literal or text literal.
- Errors don't show in the unit editor itself
- Alias target should be unit editor, but just complain if it's not a single unit
- Errors are shown with Number{ } even when the cursor hasn't left the units
- Add collapse recipe, expand (flat map) transform
- When user tries to edit cell result of calculation, offer to edit expression as well as offer manual edit.
- Need an Aggregate guide
- Didn't realise you can click on table header to edit it
- Calculate adding column does not put it at the end, which is odd.
- Allow re-ordering calculate columns?  And IDS columns
- Is it worth working out what type should be in each hole?  Would involve type-checking with that item forced to MutVar then displaying that MutVar result.
 - Add "Transform type" recipe?
- Column titles should be highlighted differently in code completion


Low Priority (good to have, but will not be hugely missed)
===
- Store import source, display in table hat?
- Choice of express install (saying what will happen) and custom install
- Collapse table could be more obvious; button in top right of table header?
- Add quick fix when trying to compare Date to DateYM?
- Quick fix proposing as type(type{Number{1}}) -- why add the {1}?  Just leave it out
- If mutvar/mutunitvar appears once in type error, replace with just underscore
 - Add quick fix for numeric literal with no units to set units to match expected type.
- Pressing down on cells should move out.  Right as well?  Check what Excel does and copy if possible
- When you create e.g. calculate, there's no explanation for why you are picking a table.  J&P figured it out, but should add an explicit label about picking source table
- When Jon (A3A4, 3:30ish) clicks expression, it shows error immediately but it shouldn't
- Expressions guide too long/intimidating.  Collapsed sections?
- Error on empty type if you defocus is "Empty brackets" which is confusing
- Being able to click on non-source table is potentially confusing.  Could add hint while hovering that this will use entire column?
- Add matching bracket/keyword highlight when editing
- Dragging table didn't move other tables out of the way -- Phil A9 1:45
- Dragging table can also cause table header to move and not be reset -- Phil A9 2:15
- Errors show after clicking to add column name, but this shouldn't count as a defocusing event.
- Add multiple columns in initial dialog?
- Auto-generated table name is confusing.

Skipping
===
 - Click to change is very generic tooltip
 - In calculate show hint to turn element(@entire C, row number) into just C?
 - Should we preview result while editing expression when possible?  Either in dialog or in actual type

Done
===


Done:
- Code complete is case sensitive?  Should be insensitive
- @case by itself didn't allow a cursor position?
- Mouse release on cell selects that, even if was part of a drag on another element.  isStillSincePress?
  - DUPE: Drag to select clicked adjacent column?
- No window title on initial window
- Confused by multiple arrows to add a new column
- Also, why are arrows blue?
- Column name and type should be formatted differently somehow
- No help text for @match keyword
- No help shown for group count
- Type editor too high/tall
- Allow column resizing
- Delete table via keyboard delete when table selected
- Joint arrow mouse-over highlight when one arrow is keyboard selected.
- Allow pixel space to drag re-order items in the concatenate table list
- Mouse-over hover indication in completion window.   Should single-click complete?
- Show auto-complete for empty expression editor?
  - Don't hide expression editor once showing if current token is deleted to zero length?
 - lex code complete isn't scrolling to keep item in view
 - Lex editor doesn't allow drag select while popup showing.  Focus issue?  Not related to popup at all?
 - Missing nested literal completions
 - Missing boolean constant completions
 - Extra space at end of lex auto complete window below listview
 - Hint to remove redundant brackets in @if/@match constructs?
 - Autosave should not be disabled, should allow placebo save.
 - Disable column show mode which is already in place, or show it as tick on menu
 - Confused by having to enter editing mode before typing.  Switch to Excel style of typing entering edit mode?
 - Truncated column names should appear in tooltip
 - Fix highlight for @entire references
 - Tip above table name field gets wrong location
 - Type signature confused with hint display (type labels versus part labels, Boolean vs Condition)
 - Highlight code more clearly in autocomplete examples.  Colour background?
 - Should description and examples be first in code complete, above the type?  Maybe type pinned at bottom as overlay?
 - Add countif/sumif functions?
 - "Confirmation" title on make manual edit dialog is weird.
 - Cancel on identifier choice should remove manual edit
 - Confusion between clicking on source or destination table for Calculate.
   - I think only allow reference to source table.
 - Auto complete wrongly positioned on second line, and does not correct?
 - When typing before item, completion didn't show.  e.g. P and A| row number should be showing P and A completion, but it did not.  Need to make completion calculation dependent on caret pos.
 - Add @entire references when blank (and related to non-@entire), and fix their display
 - Why in a[b]-c[d] does missing operator show after c but not after a?
 - Square brackets for array indexing -- show quick fix to element function
 - Need general guide for expressions, as well as guide for things like conversion
 - Add recipe for prev/next rows, which show up when typing those keywords?
 - Add pinned scrolling to lex completion
 - Autocomplete details for column items in webview
 - Error background not showing for invalid cells and showing when it shouldn't
 - Calculate allows use of self column when editing existing column (add a test for this)
 - Make @entire appear far down the list.
 - Related function synonyms not showing

 Done after Jon A sent:
 - Table highlight living after table deleted or resized or undone
 - Aliasing on Columnal logo in initial window
 - Double click doesn't do word selection in editor
 - Ctrl/Alt to move by word
 - Cache column LHS in a double[] and use that in sumColumnWidths (RHS - LHS)
 - Row label confusing when table is up against edge.
 - Fix VirtGridIndiv layout to not be O(X*Y*N); must be a better way of finding which table has cell there.  Request rectangles then adjust in and out of list as X and Y change?
 - Could we even rollback the loading fix with this?  (Though not the runlater known rows fix)
 - Fix resizing of column header item after double-clicking name.
 - Show conversion guide when you type convert
 - Fix alignment of unfocused numbers
 - Also, number left-aligned -- should be right-aligned once complete
 - Fix pref column width of number columns when they have ellipsis
 - Launch when done
 - Run launch4j automatically
 - Save the column widths
 - Stop showing column name auto complete on column edit until typing begins
 - Offer Number{<i>unit</i>} completion
 - Some cells are randomly right-aligned; not being reset to left-alignment upon reuse?
 - Add auto-trim strings option on import, ticked by default.
 - Import says "Columns 2-8 of 7"
 - Add divider above recipes.
- Need a way to show help text for function while filling in its parameters
- Add fix or hint when referencing source column in calculate that is redefined in this table.
- Description above filter in edit dialog
- Description above expression in aggregate dialog
- Stop showing zero height auto completions with grey border
- Fix overall aggregate edit, overlapping label
 - Fixed text wrapping of unfocused Text DTF cells
 - Aggregate two stage is too confusing?  Show all in one dialog, Left-Right panes?
 - Recipes in aggregate.
- Fix styling (including pick-column dialog)
- If you try to name an aggregate column after an existing column, you get a nasty internal error
 - Not helped by aggregate offering to complete a column name via click
 - Close completion when item triggered.
- Don't fill in "true" for the filter expression, more confusing than helpful. -- Fill in still but select all for easy replacement.
- Type error message: say Date, not YEARMONTHDAY
- When you type "text" into expression editor, it is not showing the related completion "from text"
 - Function param prompt doesn't show if round brackets totally empty, e.g. date().
 - Filter expression dialog allows OK click while in invisible error, without then showing the error.
 - Show temporal literal options before functions
 - Aggregate shows error "Cannot find source column Sales" !?
 - Rename the date, time, etc functions to avoid direct clash with literal.
 - Have some way in aggregate to show lowest/highest plus other info columns
 - Rubbish error message for date{2016}.
 - Stop function param blinking on and off as you move caret across
 - Stop showing param 0 wrongly after trailing comma (e.g. try date(1,2,3) -- put cursor directly before 2 and the prompt for first param and second param both show)
 - When you enter expression from text to(type{},Initial release date), the error background shows way off -- on the t in initial release date, rather than the empty type literal.  On Mac.
 - Filter warns that Initial release date is recalculated in this table.... but it isn't!  At least the per-row isn't -- should only warn for @entire.  Change type of isAltered?
 - Table column header is not used in URL import, but is used in file import of same content!?
 - Type error shows for whole function call, not just parameter which is wrong
 - Improve error message when problem is mismatched number of parameters.
 - Quick Fix for adding/subtracting dates
 - Add test and fix for RSVP dependency refresh issue.
   - When you delete the source table, all other tables still show, including its direct calculate

Done after Phil B & Jon A:
 - Set file associations in installer and software (.clml)
 - Column resize bar sometimes doesn't update correctly after a double-click.
 - Made empty columns resize to default when double-clicked
 - Add operators to the code completion and animated them.
 - Column resize bar initially shows no markings -- sometimes?
 - Related completions sometimes have gap above if very few direct completions (type "text" to see the issue)
 - Rounded corners at edges of focused expand cell show grey square background
 - Offer hovering prompt for keyword items (@if @then @else @endif) when filling in, like we do for function calls
 - Add @let to expressions
 - Add @function for lambdas
- Record system
- New unit dialog lacks title, as does edit-units dialog.
- Edit units dialog has bizarre sort order for built-in units.
- Edit/Remove unit are enabled even when no units selected
- Fix issue with help box hover in edit-unit dialog
- Creating unit in quick fix doesn't remove the error, and quick fix can be triggered twice.
- Make Excel file import offer number-or-blank for columns
- Make Excel import handle rowspan/colspan

- Typo in column type hint: "such as trying to multiple two text items together"
- extract number is Text -> Number{u}, but I think should just be Text -> Number.
- extract number should be called number from ?
- replace many function added
- Import HTML table window has no title
  - Instruction formatting could be better; not separate from the webpage below
- NOFIX: Import HTML table covers table wrongly if table wider than import pane
  - The div is right, it's the original HTML which is wrongly overflowing.
- "Imported preview" label is right-aligned but that makes it easy to miss.  Left-align it above the dest side
  - Added arrow instead
  - Original data already has munged table titles; should it?
- Selecting multiple cells not possible with mouse shift-click.
  - Does it work with keyboard?
- After Jon Neil column clicked, no completions showing; should already be fixed by today's changes so that it shows operators?
- More spacing/better formatting to separate function documentation examples
- Had "nu" in completion, selected "extract number()" related completion, got "nextract number()".  Surely should replace whole stem up to cursor?
- Add a button/link to insert function example into editor?
- Nudge scrolling is not working in import dialog while selecting
- Add context menu option to source table to transform from that table
- No error message is shown in manual edit primary key dialog
- Maximum recipe dialog doesn't show error
- Delete expected to clear cell while unfocused, but doesn't
- Caret is off by a pixel or two while editing data cell (Phil B3_2 03:40)
- Double-clicking on function completion, the cursor seems to *later* move beyond the brackets, see Phil B5 02:45 (happened multiple times)
- Clicking one too many times on autocomplete accidentally clicked column beneath.  Add invulnerability period which prevents selecting column soon after autocomplete click?
- About Dialog
- Add update-available notifications (requires website!)
- Desktop shortcut
- When editing @entire P and A to @entire J and N, deleting the P and retyping J removes the space.  Whitespace trimming problematic, at least around cursor?  Or just trim nothing, but it will be gone on reload?
  - Also do better fix for retaining spaces
  - Should we allow spaces even if they are later trimmed?
- Layout of new unit dialog is horrible, box the two options better and indent beneath.
  - Add prompt for existing unit in equal to (rename to "define as"?) and remove for Short Description
- Video Phil B2, ~2:40, column resize on empty first column goes weird.  Already fixed bug?
- Code completion for unit editor is sorted really weirdly
- Picked Edit transformation to replace a value; overlooked Calculate because it said "new value"
- Autocomplete list not very apparent what the kind of each item is.
- Why does Jon get error in Round cells the first time?  (A3A4 5:30).  Answer: because trailing space preserved due to caret being there.  Now fixed.
- Autocomplete list doesn't make it clear that you can scroll it.
  - Scroll in code completion only scrolls to end of selected/current selection, it will not expand the other regions and scroll into them -- but it should
- Mac build
