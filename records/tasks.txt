Probably fixed by recent changes but not definite
---
- Phil B3_1 12:07 autocomplete is blank, ditto B5 1:19
- Why doesn't Pete Antony completion show?  (Jon A3A4, 4:40, and 6:00ish)  Code completion blank but shouldn't be.


High Priority (major bugs/deficiencies, cannot do beta without fixing)
===
- Server internal exception logging (and stats logging?)

- Lots of confusion between date literals and date functions.
- Record syntax does not directly solve the "to date" from datetime, datetimezoned problems.
  - But could offer an hms from time that gives back all three in a record, rather than individual accessors.
- Fix three issues with irritating diff (see vcs/tic commit 21/07/19, 20:39 or so)


Medium Priority (significant quality of life, but not essential especially for beta)
===
- Could improve table name on HTML import; number doesn't need so many digits!
- Text entry box for row and column limits in the import dialog?
- Undo area/Reset area, rename to selection?
- No mouse-over highlight in table autocomplete
- Bit weird in type dialog specifically to have the autocomplete insert at cursor rather than replacing altogether. But maybe we just have to live with that?
- Conversion from Text to Date highlighted all rows as wrong; but surely the valid dates should have converted?
- Looked for text to date by typing date, but function is from text
- Calculate: not clear how to abandon but save.  Change OK/Cancel to Save/Remove?
- Number column formatting doesn't re-run when dragging column divider, which is confusing.  Run more frequently during drag?
- Have to click too many times on completion in Aggregate dialog (Phil B7_1 3:10); should only be two at most?
- Add quick fix for case of comparing temporal type to number literal or text literal.
- Errors don't show in the unit editor itself
- Alias target should be unit editor, but just complain if it's not a single unit
- Add collapse recipe, expand (flat map) transform
- When user tries to edit cell result of calculation, offer to edit expression as well as offer manual edit.
- Need an Aggregate guide
- Didn't realise you can click on table header to edit it
- Calculate adding column does not put it at the end, which is odd.
- Allow re-ordering calculate columns?  And IDS columns
- Is it worth working out what type should be in each hole?  Would involve type-checking with that item forced to MutVar then displaying that MutVar result.
 - Add "Transform type" recipe?
- Column titles should be highlighted differently in code completion
- Add explanation system for errors, to give a sort of stack trace of error cause
- Errors in number columns seem to get right-shifted by the NumberColumnFormatter.
- When using quick fix to move column to new Calculate, scroll to it -- and re-open the calculation?
  - Check what happens if used while column name is blank.
- Allow importing variable length rows into list type
- Quick fix not offered when literal lacked units, in expression: @ifN100m Time=~Is(x)@then100{m}/x@else0@endif
- When text file is UTF16, UTF8 is selected by default.


Low Priority (good to have, but will not be hugely missed)
===
- Store import source, display in table hat?
- Choice of express install (saying what will happen) and custom install
- Collapse table could be more obvious; button in top right of table header?
- Add quick fix when trying to compare Date to DateYM?
- Quick fix proposing as type(type{Number{1}}) -- why add the {1}?  Just leave it out
- If mutvar/mutunitvar appears once in type error, replace with just underscore
 - Add quick fix for numeric literal with no units to set units to match expected type.
- Pressing down on cells should move out.  Right as well?  Check what Excel does and copy if possible
- When you create e.g. calculate, there's no explanation for why you are picking a table.  J&P figured it out, but should add an explicit label about picking source table
- When Jon (A3A4, 3:30ish) clicks expression, it shows error immediately but it shouldn't
- Expressions guide too long/intimidating.  Collapsed sections?
- Error on empty type if you defocus is "Empty brackets" which is confusing
- Being able to click on non-source table is potentially confusing.  Could add hint while hovering that this will use entire column?
- Add matching bracket/keyword highlight when editing
- Dragging table didn't move other tables out of the way -- Phil A9 1:45
- Dragging table can also cause table header to move and not be reset -- Phil A9 2:15
- Errors show after clicking to add column name, but this shouldn't count as a defocusing event.
- Add multiple columns in initial dialog?
- Auto-generated table name is confusing.
- Long value tooltip wrong size on first show
- Manual edit pick primary key is too confusing (add help box?)


Skipping
===
 - Click to change is very generic tooltip
 - In calculate show hint to turn element(@entire C, row number) into just C?
 - Should we preview result while editing expression when possible?  Either in dialog or in actual type

Done
===


Done:
- Code complete is case sensitive?  Should be insensitive
- @case by itself didn't allow a cursor position?
- Mouse release on cell selects that, even if was part of a drag on another element.  isStillSincePress?
  - DUPE: Drag to select clicked adjacent column?
- No window title on initial window
- Confused by multiple arrows to add a new column
- Also, why are arrows blue?
- Column name and type should be formatted differently somehow
- No help text for @match keyword
- No help shown for group count
- Type editor too high/tall
- Allow column resizing
- Delete table via keyboard delete when table selected
- Joint arrow mouse-over highlight when one arrow is keyboard selected.
- Allow pixel space to drag re-order items in the concatenate table list
- Mouse-over hover indication in completion window.   Should single-click complete?
- Show auto-complete for empty expression editor?
  - Don't hide expression editor once showing if current token is deleted to zero length?
 - lex code complete isn't scrolling to keep item in view
 - Lex editor doesn't allow drag select while popup showing.  Focus issue?  Not related to popup at all?
 - Missing nested literal completions
 - Missing boolean constant completions
 - Extra space at end of lex auto complete window below listview
 - Hint to remove redundant brackets in @if/@match constructs?
 - Autosave should not be disabled, should allow placebo save.
 - Disable column show mode which is already in place, or show it as tick on menu
 - Confused by having to enter editing mode before typing.  Switch to Excel style of typing entering edit mode?
 - Truncated column names should appear in tooltip
 - Fix highlight for @entire references
 - Tip above table name field gets wrong location
 - Type signature confused with hint display (type labels versus part labels, Boolean vs Condition)
 - Highlight code more clearly in autocomplete examples.  Colour background?
 - Should description and examples be first in code complete, above the type?  Maybe type pinned at bottom as overlay?
 - Add countif/sumif functions?
 - "Confirmation" title on make manual edit dialog is weird.
 - Cancel on identifier choice should remove manual edit
 - Confusion between clicking on source or destination table for Calculate.
   - I think only allow reference to source table.
 - Auto complete wrongly positioned on second line, and does not correct?
 - When typing before item, completion didn't show.  e.g. P and A| row number should be showing P and A completion, but it did not.  Need to make completion calculation dependent on caret pos.
 - Add @entire references when blank (and related to non-@entire), and fix their display
 - Why in a[b]-c[d] does missing operator show after c but not after a?
 - Square brackets for array indexing -- show quick fix to element function
 - Need general guide for expressions, as well as guide for things like conversion
 - Add recipe for prev/next rows, which show up when typing those keywords?
 - Add pinned scrolling to lex completion
 - Autocomplete details for column items in webview
 - Error background not showing for invalid cells and showing when it shouldn't
 - Calculate allows use of self column when editing existing column (add a test for this)
 - Make @entire appear far down the list.
 - Related function synonyms not showing

 Done after Jon A sent:
 - Table highlight living after table deleted or resized or undone
 - Aliasing on Columnal logo in initial window
 - Double click doesn't do word selection in editor
 - Ctrl/Alt to move by word
 - Cache column LHS in a double[] and use that in sumColumnWidths (RHS - LHS)
 - Row label confusing when table is up against edge.
 - Fix VirtGridIndiv layout to not be O(X*Y*N); must be a better way of finding which table has cell there.  Request rectangles then adjust in and out of list as X and Y change?
 - Could we even rollback the loading fix with this?  (Though not the runlater known rows fix)
 - Fix resizing of column header item after double-clicking name.
 - Show conversion guide when you type convert
 - Fix alignment of unfocused numbers
 - Also, number left-aligned -- should be right-aligned once complete
 - Fix pref column width of number columns when they have ellipsis
 - Launch when done
 - Run launch4j automatically
 - Save the column widths
 - Stop showing column name auto complete on column edit until typing begins
 - Offer Number{<i>unit</i>} completion
 - Some cells are randomly right-aligned; not being reset to left-alignment upon reuse?
 - Add auto-trim strings option on import, ticked by default.
 - Import says "Columns 2-8 of 7"
 - Add divider above recipes.
- Need a way to show help text for function while filling in its parameters
- Add fix or hint when referencing source column in calculate that is redefined in this table.
- Description above filter in edit dialog
- Description above expression in aggregate dialog
- Stop showing zero height auto completions with grey border
- Fix overall aggregate edit, overlapping label
 - Fixed text wrapping of unfocused Text DTF cells
 - Aggregate two stage is too confusing?  Show all in one dialog, Left-Right panes?
 - Recipes in aggregate.
- Fix styling (including pick-column dialog)
- If you try to name an aggregate column after an existing column, you get a nasty internal error
 - Not helped by aggregate offering to complete a column name via click
 - Close completion when item triggered.
- Don't fill in "true" for the filter expression, more confusing than helpful. -- Fill in still but select all for easy replacement.
- Type error message: say Date, not YEARMONTHDAY
- When you type "text" into expression editor, it is not showing the related completion "from text"
 - Function param prompt doesn't show if round brackets totally empty, e.g. date().
 - Filter expression dialog allows OK click while in invisible error, without then showing the error.
 - Show temporal literal options before functions
 - Aggregate shows error "Cannot find source column Sales" !?
 - Rename the date, time, etc functions to avoid direct clash with literal.
 - Have some way in aggregate to show lowest/highest plus other info columns
 - Rubbish error message for date{2016}.
 - Stop function param blinking on and off as you move caret across
 - Stop showing param 0 wrongly after trailing comma (e.g. try date(1,2,3) -- put cursor directly before 2 and the prompt for first param and second param both show)
 - When you enter expression from text to(type{},Initial release date), the error background shows way off -- on the t in initial release date, rather than the empty type literal.  On Mac.
 - Filter warns that Initial release date is recalculated in this table.... but it isn't!  At least the per-row isn't -- should only warn for @entire.  Change type of isAltered?
 - Table column header is not used in URL import, but is used in file import of same content!?
 - Type error shows for whole function call, not just parameter which is wrong
 - Improve error message when problem is mismatched number of parameters.
 - Quick Fix for adding/subtracting dates
 - Add test and fix for RSVP dependency refresh issue.
   - When you delete the source table, all other tables still show, including its direct calculate

Done after Phil B & Jon A:
 - Set file associations in installer and software (.clml)
 - Column resize bar sometimes doesn't update correctly after a double-click.
 - Made empty columns resize to default when double-clicked
 - Add operators to the code completion and animated them.
 - Column resize bar initially shows no markings -- sometimes?
 - Related completions sometimes have gap above if very few direct completions (type "text" to see the issue)
 - Rounded corners at edges of focused expand cell show grey square background
 - Offer hovering prompt for keyword items (@if @then @else @endif) when filling in, like we do for function calls
 - Add @let to expressions
 - Add @function for lambdas
- Record system
- New unit dialog lacks title, as does edit-units dialog.
- Edit units dialog has bizarre sort order for built-in units.
- Edit/Remove unit are enabled even when no units selected
- Fix issue with help box hover in edit-unit dialog
- Creating unit in quick fix doesn't remove the error, and quick fix can be triggered twice.
- Make Excel file import offer number-or-blank for columns
- Make Excel import handle rowspan/colspan

- Typo in column type hint: "such as trying to multiple two text items together"
- extract number is Text -> Number{u}, but I think should just be Text -> Number.
- extract number should be called number from ?
- replace many function added
- Import HTML table window has no title
  - Instruction formatting could be better; not separate from the webpage below
- NOFIX: Import HTML table covers table wrongly if table wider than import pane
  - The div is right, it's the original HTML which is wrongly overflowing.
- "Imported preview" label is right-aligned but that makes it easy to miss.  Left-align it above the dest side
  - Added arrow instead
  - Original data already has munged table titles; should it?
- Selecting multiple cells not possible with mouse shift-click.
  - Does it work with keyboard?
- After Jon Neil column clicked, no completions showing; should already be fixed by today's changes so that it shows operators?
- More spacing/better formatting to separate function documentation examples
- Had "nu" in completion, selected "extract number()" related completion, got "nextract number()".  Surely should replace whole stem up to cursor?
- Add a button/link to insert function example into editor?
- Nudge scrolling is not working in import dialog while selecting
- Add context menu option to source table to transform from that table
- No error message is shown in manual edit primary key dialog
- Maximum recipe dialog doesn't show error
- Delete expected to clear cell while unfocused, but doesn't
- Caret is off by a pixel or two while editing data cell (Phil B3_2 03:40)
- Double-clicking on function completion, the cursor seems to *later* move beyond the brackets, see Phil B5 02:45 (happened multiple times)
- Clicking one too many times on autocomplete accidentally clicked column beneath.  Add invulnerability period which prevents selecting column soon after autocomplete click?
- About Dialog
- Add update-available notifications (requires website!)
- Desktop shortcut
- When editing @entire P and A to @entire J and N, deleting the P and retyping J removes the space.  Whitespace trimming problematic, at least around cursor?  Or just trim nothing, but it will be gone on reload?
  - Also do better fix for retaining spaces
  - Should we allow spaces even if they are later trimmed?
- Layout of new unit dialog is horrible, box the two options better and indent beneath.
  - Add prompt for existing unit in equal to (rename to "define as"?) and remove for Short Description
- Video Phil B2, ~2:40, column resize on empty first column goes weird.  Already fixed bug?
- Code completion for unit editor is sorted really weirdly
- Picked Edit transformation to replace a value; overlooked Calculate because it said "new value"
- Autocomplete list not very apparent what the kind of each item is.
- Why does Jon get error in Round cells the first time?  (A3A4 5:30).  Answer: because trailing space preserved due to caret being there.  Now fixed.
- Autocomplete list doesn't make it clear that you can scroll it.
  - Scroll in code completion only scrolls to end of selected/current selection, it will not expand the other regions and scroll into them -- but it should
- Mac build
- Try adding white or black fade to show there is more to show in each lex auto complete section
- KeyValueExpression.visit is being called during this, which is wrong.
  Should we either make this expression first class or dump it?
- Expression editor is not saving brackets around records in:
  from text(replace many([(find:"nw",replace:"0"),(find:"-",replace:"-")],Wind m s))
- Add link to green info prompt for functions that lets you show function documentation
- Errors are shown with Number{ } even when the cursor hasn't left the units
- Duplicate completion exception in empty Number{ }
- Change C instructions to ask user to fix en dash insanity
- If you calculate based on table Src with column A, and calculate a column X, then edit X's name to A (to overwrite column), X is still there when you click OK.
- The error for an invalid syntax expression in calculate is also awful.  Unknown error with table; why not error from the expression itself?
- No undo while editing a cell value
- The error for dividing by Optional still has the minus operator in the type "Optional-(Number)" but it shouldn't
- Ctrl-C for copy doesn't work when editing cell data values
- Bold the calculate columns which are actually new/overwritten
- If you have e.g. @if true @then 100{m} @else 0 @endif then you get an error on the whole if for the mismatch in type units, but it should only show on the else branch to be clearer (assume then-branch is correct)
- If you try to type "Number" after an opening bracket you end up with "N u m b e r" which is super-weird
- Loading this expression in editor inserts a "unit" before the unit: @ifN100m Time=~Optional\Is(m)@then100{m}/m@else@ifN100yd time=~Optional\Is(y)@thenas unit({m/s},100{yard}/y)@else0{m/s}@endif@endif
- Make it more apparent that you can click to insert examples.
- Minus sign is missing from formatted number display of columns, -0.1 shows as 0.1
- No right-click context menu (at least with cut/copy/paste) when editing cell value
- No right-click context menu (at least with cut/copy/paste) when editing expression
- There is no undo in the expression editor
- Make up and down work sensibly in expression editor when autocomplete isn't showing.
- Clicking header row of a check doesn't (visually?) select the table
- Format check display to be red title when failing, green when passing.
- If you position cursor at start of Wind m s item, you get info message twice.  Also: don't show this if that's the exact column name we are calculating; pretty obvious it can't self reference!
- Give a useful error when you try to use a column defined in this same calculate (and offer quick fix to add new calculate to help out)
- Check display has no context menu when right-clicking header
- If unit completion only has related items then the layout can be screwed up
- Unit completion after "m" only shows related items, but isn't "m" a direct completion?
- Check does not show any/all rows edit, only expression, when edit link clicked
- Check and Filter lets you click OK even if the expression isn't boolean 
- Add a tooltip-like system for long values but don't use tooltips (separate windows bad), use another layer in the grid view.
- Try to stop the layout pinging around so much when adding/removing brackets in an if.  Let outer scope still complete even if inner scope didn't?
- If you type '{' after Number, you don't get the completions for units immediately, you have to move caret in and out 
- When you autocomplete Number, it shows error immediately
- Add a guide for Optional, linked to when an error might be solved by adding/removing an Optional type (technically: by removing Optional from one side or the other)
- Show other guides at all times
- Show units guide as a quick fix for mismatched units.
- Improve guide for units - several smaller sections, make it clear how to convert units.
- Make the expression editor wider and slightly taller by default.
- Division by zero in an expression shows "Loading..." forever.
- Allow insertable expressions from DocWindow (remember which editor caused it)
- The expression @ifN100m Time=~Optional\Is(x)@then100{m}/x@else@ifN100yd time=~Optional\Is(x)@thenas unit(unit{m/s},100{yard}/x)@else0{m/s}@endif@endif should be valid, but it complains about trying to use undeclared variable x.
- When using the quick fix on the error about "column is defined in this table, make new transformation to use it", nothing happened after clicking the quick fix other than closing the editor.  Ditto the info warning about using column redefined in this table.
- Add mention of how to introduce units to the units guide, and to the as unit function.
- Add a join transformation, with inner join and left join (I think left join is just a tickbox on inner join?)
- Allow unicode specifier in strings (^uXXXX)
- Add recent projects to main menu window
- Manual edit row number should not be default
- No autocomplete on picking column in manual edit
- Manual edit dialog pick column is modal and doesn't allow column picking
- Manual edit summary dialog very weird when no edits to show
- Manual edit summary dialog too small, and not resizable
- Manual edit "N entries" header doesn't update after an edit
- No way to change manual edit key after creation (should be shown as editable link in table head)
- Add multiple export formats; XLSX and HTML alongside CSV
- Make the source table highlight (and show an arrow?) when you hover over an editable source table link
- Undo area in import dialog does not redisplay RHS
- Investigate improving layout for long expressions: done if, define, match
- Add autocompletes for full define, match (like we have for if)
- Click to insert doesn't work on the @match examples, @if examples, operators, type/unit literals.
- @define, @enddefine and more are not right colour
- If you have an invalid column name XX, you get a quick fix offered to "Make a new calculation that can use this table's XX" -- but XX doesn't exist. 
- If you import text file where one column has all same values, but no numbers, it gets treated as Optional(Number)!
- Can't make a new table by pasting from clipboard (from HTML page)
- Click to insert doesn't work on temporal input literals (inputArg)
- Documentation for @define and @function and ? is missing.
- Allow AM/PM in data entry (and more generally, more flexible date recognisers?)
- When importing, not obvious that blank item on separator drop down is tab.
- Add graphical element to display and edit comments
- When you click sum recipe in aggregate, it says compare column
